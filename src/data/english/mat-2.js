1 Now, Jesus having been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, learned men from the east arrived in Jerusalem,
2 saying, “Where is the one having been born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east and came to worship him.”
3 But having heard this, Herod the king became troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
4 And having brought together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired from them, “Where is the Christ being born?”
5 And they said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it has been written through the prophet,
6 ‘And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the leaders of Judah, for from you will come out a ruling one who will shepherd my people Israel.’”
7 Then Herod, having secretly called the learned men, inquired from them the time of the appearing of the star.
8 And having sent them to Bethlehem, he said, “Having gone, search carefully for the young child, and after you have found him, report to me so that I also, having come, might worship him.”
9 And they, having heard the king, went on their way, and behold, the star that they saw in the east was going before them until, having come, it stood over where the young child was.
10 And having seen the star, they rejoiced with very great joy.
11 And having gone into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother. And having fallen down, they worshiped him, and having opened their treasures, they offered him gifts: gold and frankincense and myrrh.
12 And having been warned through a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their country by another way.
13 Now they having departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appears to Joseph by means of a dream, saying, “Having gotten up, take the young child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is going to seek the young child to kill him.”
14 And having gotten up, he took the young child and his mother at night and departed for Egypt,
15 and he was there until the death of Herod, in order that might be fulfilled {what} was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”
16 Then Herod, having seen that he had been mocked by the learned men, was very angry, and having sent forth, he killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its region, from two years and under, according to the time that he had determined exactly from the learned men.
17 Then was fulfilled {what} was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
18 “A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and not willing to be comforted, because they are no more.”
19 Now Herod having died, behold, an angel of the Lord appears through a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
20 saying, “Having gotten up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for the ones seeking the life of the child have died.”
21 And he, having gotten up, took the child and his mother, and entered into the land of Israel.
22 But having heard that Archelaus is reigning over Judea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. But having been warned by means of a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee,
23 and having gone there, he lived in a city being called Nazareth, so that it might be fulfilled {what} was spoken through the prophets, that he will be called a Nazarene.
