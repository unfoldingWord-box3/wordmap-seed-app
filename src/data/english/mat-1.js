2 Abraham fathered Isaac, and Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers,
3 and Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez fathered Hezron, and Hezron fathered Ram,
4 and Ram fathered Amminadab, and Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon,
5 and Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth, and Obed fathered Jesse,
6 and Jesse fathered David the king, and David fathered Solomon by the {wife} of Uriah,
7 and Solomon fathered Rehoboam, and Rehoboam fathered Abijah, and Abijah fathered Asa,
8 and Asa fathered Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, and Joram fathered Uzziah,
9 and Uzziah fathered Jotham, and Jotham fathered Ahaz, and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah,
10 and Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, and Manasseh fathered Amon, and Amon fathered Josiah,
11 and Josiah fathered Jechoniah and his brothers at the Babylonian deportation,
12 and after the Babylonian deportation, Jechoniah fathered Shealtiel, and Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel,
13 and Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, and Abiud fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor,
14 and Azor fathered Zadok, and Zadok fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Eliud,
15 and Eliud fathered Eleazar, and Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob,
16 and Jacob fathered Joseph the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, the one called Christ.
17 Therefore, all the generations from Abraham until David {were} 14 generations, and from David until the Babylonian deportation {were} 14 generations, and from the Babylonian deportation until the Christ {were} 14 generations.
18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was thus: His mother, Mary, having been engaged to marry Joseph, before they came together, was found having in the womb from the Holy Spirit.
19 Now Joseph her husband, being righteous, and not wanting to publicly disgrace her, he intended to divorce her secretly.
20 But he having reflected on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him by way of a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, you should not fear to take Mary as your wife, because the one having been conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
21 And she will bear a son, and you will call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.”
22 Now all this happened so that might be fulfilled {what} was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
23 “Behold, the virgin will have in her womb and bear a son, and they will call his name Immanuel”—which is translated, “God with us.”
24 And Joseph, having been awakened from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took her {as} his wife.
25 And he did not know her until she bore a son. And he called his name Jesus.
